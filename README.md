# Linking Neural Measures to Visual Performance
 
This repository contains the scripts used for data analysis in Noor Alteneiji's capstone project. 

# Prerequisites 
The scripts in this repository have the following MATLAB dependencies:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox 

# About the scripts 
Start by running 'RunAnalysis.m'. Raw data will already be pulled from google sheets. 
Once you run this script, a 'Figures' folder will be created with all the image files for the figures. 

Running 'Stereoacuity_Perimetry_Model.m' will initiate the linear fixed effects model.
